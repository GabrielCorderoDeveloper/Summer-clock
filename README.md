# Summer-clock


This is a simple web application to show the day, hour and weather while showing dynamic and changing backgrounds of beaches.

## About the project
The project was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript and Bootstrap. The dynamic background was achieved using the Unsplash API and changes the background every 6 seconds. To avoid making many calls to the API, first 5 images are fetched from the API and then every 6 seconds, one of these 5 images is selected randomly.

To display the weather, it uses the ipdata API to locate where the device IP is located and then uses the weatherapi API to display the weather in a visually pleasing way.
